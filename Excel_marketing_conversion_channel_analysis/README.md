## Actionable Insights


Campaign 3 had the highest percentage of purchases in both the Store and Deal channel. This suggests that customers were more inclined to make purchases through these channels during Campaign 3 compared to the other campaigns, indicating the effectiveness of these channels in driving customer engagement and potential conversions. Therefore, to recreate the success of Campaign 3, focusing on both the Store and Web channels would be advisable.

                                                    Data Exploration
1. Calculated conversion rate in percentage by each marketing campaign (customer who accepted the offer after the campaign/ total customers from that campaign)*100
2. Calculated percentage of total purchases for each channel (customer who accepted the offer after the campaign from a specific channel / total customers from that campaign from a specific channel)*100
  
    
                                                   Tableau Visualization 
1. Visualized the highest conversion rate with darker color to highlight key insights, and used lighter color to downplay less important details, such as unsuccessful campaigns.
