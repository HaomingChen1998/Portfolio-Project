# Overview
Source from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fibonamew/insurance-data
- This dataset contains information about 7 features and the actual medical charges incurred by over 1300 customers within ACME Insurance Inc. The age column from this dataset is from 18-64, so assuming no Medicare plans.
- The purpose of this project is to visualize the most profitable consumer profiles for ACME Insurance Inc and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising campaigns.
- In my case, target consumer is defined as the group of consumer that generate maximum revenue (highest charge)

# Actionable Insights
- Discovered the 2 most correlated consumer features in respect to the company's revenue are smoking status with
79% correlation and age with 30% correlation.
- Executed advance SQL queries and developed concise Tableau visualizations that showed the most profitable
consumer profiles which will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising campaigns. Ex: Are smoker consumers more profitable than non-smoker consumers? Are senior consumers more profitable than adolescent consumers? (In process)
