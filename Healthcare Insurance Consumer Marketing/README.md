# Overview
Source from [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fibonamew/insurance-data)]
- Created Python code using BeautifulSoup that automated the web scrapping and Excel data recording processes for daily gas price fluctuation which eliminated 100% of human data entry.
- It records different type of gases such as regular, mid grade, premium, diesel, and e85.
- This code runs once every 24 hours as long as the Jupyter Notebook is still running in the background.
