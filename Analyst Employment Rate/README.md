# Overview: Factors of Data Analyst Applicants Employment Rate
Source from: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey  
The survey was fielded from May 11, 2022 to June 1, 2022  
This data contains 5,635,211 counts of data.  
- Solved a real job-hunting problem by providing meaningful employment insights for inexperienced analyst utilizing a large employment dataset with over 5 million counts of data
-  Executed complex SQL queries that analyzed how a candidate employment rate were under the influence of skills, countries, working models, and coding experience.

## ðŸ›  Skills
Excel, SQL, Tableau


## Summary [What actions can you take?]


1. What skills to learn first? (List top 3 skills from most popular to least popular)
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Platform: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
- Programming Language: SQL, Python, JavaScript
2. Which country has the highest employment rate for inexperienced analyst with less than 2 years of coding experience? Relocation should be considered if you arenâ€™t getting any luck in your current location. (List from highest to lowest)
- Brazil, India, United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, Germany, Australia.
3. Does education matters?
- Not so much, you should focus on building your skills and experience because the results showed most employed analyst had lower education.
4. Which working model has the highest employment rate with less than 2 years of coding experience? (List from highest to lowest)
- In-person, Remote, Hybrid. This indicates that most companies still prefer in-person applicants for inexperienced analyst than Remote and Hybrid. You should apply for all the in-person jobs first, then apply for remote and hybrid positions to increase your chance of getting hired.




## Procedure

                                                     Data Cleaning  
  **Excel:** 
1.	Replaced 54080 corrupted punctuation (Ã¢â‚¬) with the correct punctuation (â€˜). 
Ex: MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to Masterâ€™s.
2.	Exported as a workbook and imported into Microsoft SQL Server.
      
        
         


   
**Microsoft SQL Server:**
1.	Removed duplicates using row_number/window function.
2.	Replaced NULL value with 0 for YearsCode column because there should be 0 to indicate a candidate without any experience in coding, but it only has NA, 1, 2, etc. Therefore, I assume NA means 0 years of experience, this will make SQL coding and visualization in Tableau easier.
3.	I couldnâ€™t populate any columns with NULL values because there wasnâ€™t a reference point.
4.	Created two new tables: a Company_Table and a Background_Table, from the cleaned dataset. Response ID is kept for each table, so join function could be used after.
-	Company_Table has columns such as Response ID as the primary key, organization size, RemoteWork (working model), total compensation, compensation frequency.
-	Background_Table has columns such as Response ID as the primary key, education level, country, DevType (current job name), employment status, database have worked with, age, gender, sex, etc.







                                                    Data Exploration
**Microsoft SQL Server:**  
Things I discovered were:
1.	Most popular/common Platform, Language, and Database skill usage counts for an employed person as a data analyst worldwide.
2.	Analyst employment rate per country with less than 2 year of coding experience (any coding education also counts toward coding experience).
3.	Analyst employment rate per education level.
4.	Analyst employment rate per working model (remote/hybrid/in-person) with less than 2 year of coding experience.
5.	Analyst global employment rate with less than 2 year of coding experience.

                                                    What I Have Learned
**Advice received from multiple Senior Data Analysts on my project while networking on Linkedin:**
1.	Perform data cleaning such as removing duplicates and populate null values first then break up the data set.
2.	Minimize the use of CTE or subquery.
3.  Use intense color to hightlight what you are trying to point out in Tableau, use lighter color for information that aren't important.
4. Do not bombard people with information, only hightlight the main focus.

**Lesson learned from doing this project from my own mistakes:**

1.	Before you remove the duplicate, use select statement to see what youâ€™re deleting, once you confirmed that everything looks correct, then change it to delete statement.
2.	Do not start query before you fully understand the dataset you are working with.
3.	Although I can remove duplicates much easier in Excel, but when the dataset becomes too large, Excel might crash while removing the duplicates, so SQL is better in terms of handling larger dataset.
4.	When I want to see the employment rate per country, I need to exclude countries where the sample size is small. Because the results wonâ€™t be significant, and they can skew the overall trend.
5.	Before importing to Tableau, make sure to replace all the NULL values with 0 because it could mistake that with a string.
