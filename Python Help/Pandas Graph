There are several plot types built into pandas; most of them are statistical by nature:

df.plot.hist()
df. plot.barh()
df. plot.line()
df. plot.area()
df. plot.hexbin()
df. plot.bar()
df. plot.scatter()
df. plot.box()
df.plot.kde()
df.plot.pie()

You can also call specific plots by passing their name as an argument, as with 
df.plot (kind=' area').
