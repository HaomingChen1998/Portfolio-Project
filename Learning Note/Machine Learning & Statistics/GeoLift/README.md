- Carbon tax is introduced in 1990, and the gas consumption goes down after 1990. The question is if this decline is really because of the carbon tax?
1. Synthetic Control Methods (SCM): It helps you to understand if something causes something esle. The average of similar states that fit the target state (NY) very well before the treatment (carbon tax). Ex. New York introduced carbon tax, Norway is similar to NY, but didn't introduce carbonx tax.

2. Counterfactual: What would it happen without? Ex: what would have happen to gas consumption if NY didn't introduce carbon tax?
3. Causal Effect: The difference between gasoline consumption with tax and gasoline consumption without tax.
