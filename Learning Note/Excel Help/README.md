# Freeze column (that is not the first column)

2. Click on "View" ribbon -> freeze panes -> freeze panes

# Percentile
1. =PERCENTILE.INC() is more common that includes the first and last value.
2. =PERCENTILE.EXC() is less common that excludes the first and last value. Also, k OR percentile will return NULL if = 0 or 1
3. If there are empty cell in between, it’s going to treat it as if it doesn’t exist, and move the next number forward.
