OR     
VCR = (View-throughs / Impressions) * 100  
a “view through” typically refers to a viewer watching an entire video ad without skipping it

<h1 align="center">Data Anomaly Check</h1>

**<small>Most recent data is significantly higher/lower 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile**<small>  
1. If relevant metrics are small, that may indiciate the ad is still in QA (Making sure the quality is good before release to the public)
- Ex: When most recent data for CTR is significantly higher than all percentiles: Check relevant metrics (clicks & Impression), if they are low, might indiciate QA.

**<small>When does percentile indicate non-issue?**<small>  
When most recent week's data is significantly:
1. Higher than 25th & 50th, but lower than 75th. (still within normalized range)
2. Lower than 75th & 50th, but higher than 25th.
3. If all higher/lower, but relevant metrics from most recent week are small numbers, that may indiciate the ad is still in QA (Making sure the quality is good before release to the public)
- Ex: When most recent data for CTR is significantly higher than all percentiles: Check relevant metrics (clicks & Impression), if they are low, might indiciate QA.
4. Higher than 25th & 50th,  75th. (still within normalized range)
5. Lower than 75th & 50th, but higher than 25th.
