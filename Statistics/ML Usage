1. Classification problems: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These models are designed to classify data points into different categories or classes based on their features.
2. Clustering problems: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering. These models are designed to group data points into clusters based on their similarity or distance from each other.
3. Regression problems: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, ARIMA. These models are designed to predict a continuous numerical value based on input variables.
4. Time Series problems: ARIMA, Prophet. These models are designed to forecast future values based on historical time series data.
